### First sale
<hr class="star-primary">

Because we wanted the MVP to include as many of the promised / identified features as possible, but also due to the fact that high school and college students are currently on winter vacation, it was quite difficult to get feedback. However, we managed to find 4 people (2 high school students and 2 students) who were kind enough to install our application on their Android devices and tell us what they like or dislike about it. We attach below their impressions:
<br><br>
<table class="w3-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th style="padding:0 20px 0 20px;">Interview of high school student</th>
        <th style="padding:0 20px 0 20px;">Interview of university student</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:0 20px 0 20px;">
            <audio controls="">
                <source src="img/liceu.mp4" type="audio/mpeg">

        </td>
        <td style="padding:0 20px 0 20px;">
            <audio controls="">
                <source src="img/student.ogg" type="audio/mpeg">

        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>

           <p>“I like the interface of the app because it is very easy to use and intuitive. Also, another feature that I like is that you can vote a question or an answer, this way being easier to see which are the most popular ones. What i didn’t like is that there is not an option to enter the app as a guest. I believe that you should include that in your next update, because some users only want to see the questions and answers, without wanting to ask anything. You should only need to login if you want to ask a question or provide feedback.”</p>

           <p>“It seems super easy to provide feedback/answer the questions and to go through the universities and threads. Even though I am already a student, it would have been nice to also be able to ask questions. Maybe I am interested in some things that I have not experienced yet and someone from a bigger year can help me with them. So I think that this could be a very useful future feature. Also, it would be helpful if you can find some information about who answered the question, like in which year of university is he in. Overall, the app is good and very promising! Keep up the good work”</p>
