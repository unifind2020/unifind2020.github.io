### Landing page updates
<hr class="star-primary">
<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>Before we started promoting the landing page, we made some changes to it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We added a subscription section and a subscription dialog box that appears the first time you access the page and each time you reload.</p> 
            <img src="img/subscribe.PNG" style="align: left; padding:0 -20px 0 -20px;">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We changed the first image on the landing page to better describe our work and what our application should do.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We integrated Hotjar and Google Analytics.</p> 
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Promoting the landing page
<hr class="star-primary">

After finishing the landing page, we started to share it on Facebook and Whatsapp where all of us are part of a comunity including many actual students, graduate students, high school students or their parents, in other words, our target audience.
<div>
    <img src="img/share_post1.PNG" alt="share post 1" width="33%">
    <img src="img/share_post2.PNG" alt="share post 2" width="33%">
    <img src="img/share_post3.PNG" alt="share post 3" width="33%">
</div>

Many people liked the idea and many of them subscribed to our newsletter.

### Google Analytics
<hr class="star-primary">
We share the landing page on December 2nd and 3rd and these days brought us the largest number of users, which gradually decreased, as expected.

![users](img/users.PNG)

People came to our page directly accessing its link or through Facebook, the main channel we used to share.

![referral](img/referral.PNG)

Most of the traffic comes from Romania as expected from our share posts, but also from other countries and with a good involvement rate which
enjoy us.

![countries](img/countries.PNG)

Most people accessed the page using a mobile device, which proves that our choice to make a mobile app was good.
